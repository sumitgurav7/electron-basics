/*
 * Promises

 * Promises are a library for asynchronous programming. 
 * A Promise represents an operation that hasn't completed yet, but is expected in the future.
 * Promises are used in many existing JavaScript libraries.
 *
 * Syntax
 * new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { ... });
 *

/*
 * States of a promise
 *
 * pending: initial state, not fulfilled or rejected.
 * fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
 * rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
